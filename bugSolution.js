To fix this, ensure that the import path accurately reflects the new location of your component.  If you renamed `MyComponent.js` to `NewComponent.js`, make sure you update all imports accordingly. For example:

Incorrect:
```javascript
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
```

Correct:
```javascript
import NewComponent from './NewComponent';
```
Double check your file names for typos and ensure the file is actually in the location you are importing from.
